# Loading State Fix for Not Found Trips

## Problem
The application was showing a loading spinner indefinitely when a trip was not found (GraphQL returns `{ "data": { "trip": null } }`).

## Root Cause
The loading state logic was not properly handling the case when:
1. GraphQL query completes successfully
2. But returns `trip: null` (trip not found)
3. The `notFound` condition wasn't being triggered correctly

## Solution

### 1. **Updated Loading State Logic**

**Before:**
```typescript
if (tripLoading || isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (tripLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />
}
```

**Why:** Removed the `isLoading` check from the loading condition because it was preventing the "not found" state from being displayed.

### 2. **Enhanced useTrip Hook**

**Before:**
```typescript
notFound: !loading && !error && data?.trip === null
```

**After:**
```typescript
const notFound = !loading && !error && data && data.trip === null
```

**Why:** More explicit check that ensures `data` exists before checking if `trip` is null.

### 3. **Updated Data Loading Effect**

**Added:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (trip && !tripLoading) {
    // Handle successful trip data
  } else if (!tripLoading && !trip) {
    // Trip loading is complete but no trip data found
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}, [trip, tripLoading])
```

**Why:** Explicitly handles the case when loading completes but no trip data is found.

## Flow Now Works Correctly

1. **Initial Load**: `tripLoading = true` → Shows loading spinner
2. **Query Completes**: `tripLoading = false`
3. **Trip Found**: `trip = {...}` → Shows trip interface
4. **Trip Not Found**: `trip = null` → Shows "Trip Not Found" message
5. **Network Error**: `error = "..."` → Shows error message

## Test Cases

✅ **Valid Trip ID**: Shows trip data
✅ **Invalid Trip ID**: Shows "Invalid Trip ID" message
✅ **Non-existent Trip**: Shows "Trip Not Found" message
✅ **Network Error**: Shows error message with retry
✅ **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner only while query is running

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed `isLoading` from loading condition** - Prevents infinite loading
2. **Enhanced `notFound` detection** - More reliable null trip detection
3. **Added explicit null handling** - Properly handles completed queries with null data
4. **Improved state management** - Clear separation between loading and not found states

The application now correctly handles all trip data states without getting stuck in loading.
